    <string name="budget_desc">This app is meant to be a way for people to budget their monthly income. The hope is to have
    three saved budget views for each person. After selecting the view the user can choose what type of budget plan they will use
    or choose to make a custom one. Most budgets use the same categories so each will have the same buttons that open different
    views where the user can enter what their purchase was. After entering the amount spent the app will auto update the amount of funds left.</string>
